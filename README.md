# Fine-Tuning an LLM for Predictive Financial Analysis

### Task
Develop and fine-tune an LLM to predict financial trends and assist in making investment decisions. The project involves collecting and preprocessing financial data, training the model, and validating its performance with real-world financial scenarios.

Create steps for this and also create three systems one simple fine tune, second use agents, third use rag.

### Diary
I was making notes throughout the whole process of developing financial predictions with LLM: https://fedserfey.notion.site/Diary-6b2d2605863040aca71840616fd8c27b


### Google Colab

Google Colab provides a nice space for using their computational power to train LLM models. I did all the work there and just downloaded the notebooks in this repo.

I had to use Kaggle to fine-tune the model: [fine-tuned-llama3-fin-pred-model](https://www.kaggle.com/models/serhey/fine-tuned-llama3-fin-pred-model/)
